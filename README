Green Shell is my personal Bash  environment. Trivial to deploy on any new
computer. Handy both for home and work.

It's unlikely that you will want to use this same set of customisations but
it could still be interesting as a template for setting up your own portable
environment.

To use it on a new computer just:
$ git clone https://github.com/greenarrow/greenshell.git .greenshell
$ cd .greenshell
$ ./install.sh
